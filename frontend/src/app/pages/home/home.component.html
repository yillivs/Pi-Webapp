        <h2>Server Sentinel</h2><br>
        <h4><strong>What is it?</strong> The Server Sentinel is designed to be a cheap and scalable server monitoring solution. With easy to configure alerts it's simple to keep yourself, or your I.T. team, up to date with all of your server room statuses. </h4><br>
        <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong> The pilot version of the Server Sentinel was designed and made for Dr. Kapenga of WMU. The release one version of the server sentinel resides in the Parkview server room here at WMU. Designed to be a cost effective replacement to the existing solution, the question of scalability arose. Future releases of server sentinel will see the ability to add new sensors aside from temperature/humidity. Allowing the Server Sentinel to live up to it's name as the be-all and end-all in server room monitoring.</p>
